            <p class="text-muted text-left">Saint Xavier High School (/ˈzeɪvjər/ ZAY-vyər;[16][17][18] often abbreviated St. X) is a private, college-preparatory high school just outside the Cincinnati city limits, in the Finneytown neighborhood of Springfield Township, Hamilton County, Ohio, United States.[19][20] The independent, non-diocesan school is operated by the Midwest Province of the Society of Jesus as one of four all-male Catholic high schools in the Archdiocese of Cincinnati. Aside from colleges and universities, St. Xavier is the second-largest private school in Ohio[21] and one of the 100 largest schools in the state,[22] with 1,514 enrolled students as of the 2018–19 school year.[6] It is the second-largest of the 35 all-male high schools run by the Society of Jesus in the United States.[21][7]

                St. Xavier is the oldest high school in the Cincinnati area[23] and one of the oldest in the nation. It grew out of the Athenaeum, which opened in 1831 in downtown Cincinnati. From 1869 to 1934, the high school program formed the lower division of St. Xavier College, now Xavier University. The high school moved to its present location in 1960.

                The Bombers football team and Aquabombers swimming and diving team have a national profile, appearing frequently at state championships and in national rankings. Graduates of St. Xavier include numerous professional athletes, three Olympians, prominent state and national politicians, influential businessmen, and noted authors and actors.</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">St. Xavier, once a part of Xavier University, traces its history to the Athenaeum at Seventh and Sycamore streets[25] in Downtown Cincinnati. The institute, which included a seminary and lay college, was dedicated by the first bishop of Cincinnati, the Most Rev. Edward D. Fenwick, O.P., on October 17, 1831. It was the first Catholic institution of higher learning in the Northwest Territory.[26] Just a week later, the city's first public high school, Woodward College, opened its doors. The Athenaeum stood until 1890, next door to The Catholic Telegraph's printing press.[27]

                In 1840, at the behest of Bishop Fenwick,[27] the Society of Jesus began operating the Athenaeum's lay college, which it renamed St. Xavier College, after St. Francis Xavier. The Congregation of the Mission (Vincentians) took over the seminary in 1841,[28] and the college was granted a 30-year state charter in 1842. St. Xavier College originally offered six years of integrated primary, secondary, and post-secondary education, in keeping with the Ratio Studiorum and the original Jesuit college in Messina, Sicily, predecessor to the University of Messina.[29] Day schoolers came from all over the city, while boarders hailed from the Deep South, Mexico, and Cuba.[30] School closed on Thursdays and Sundays until 1917. Originally, until 1851, admission was granted to students ages 8 to 16.[31] Later, a tuition-free elementary school division opened to complement the college.[23] In 1844, the school's elementary division opened a boarding school campus in Walnut Hills but was forced to close its doors two years later and return downtown.[32]</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-lef"> In the 1850s, falling enrollment, threat of bankruptcy, and cholera brought about proposals to close the high school division.[23] Jesuit schools had opened in the South, contributing to declining enrollment. The situation was worsened by the local anti-Catholic and Know Nothing sentiment that culminated in the Cincinnati riot of 1853. Beginning the fall of 1854, St. Xavier stopped admitting boarders altogether, becoming a primarily local institute, to reduce the financial burden on its students' families.[33]

                On May 7, 1869, St. Xavier's charter was extended in perpetuity by an act of the General Assembly.[34] Later that year, the school began distinguishing between academic and collegiate departments. Three years of high school would be followed by one year each of the humanities, poetry, rhetoric, and philosophy.[35][36]

                At the close of the 19th century, St. Xavier's athletic teams competed in the Interscholastic Athletic Association of Cincinnati.[37] </p>
